# note_flow
This is a note flow app a Progressive Web App build using html, css and vanilla js. Focused on the UI part. Added manifest.json to make it a PWA . Kept very simple, yet very elegant, with a pastel color pallet. The changes you make are saved in local storage, so no matter your refresh the page, it will be saved.
